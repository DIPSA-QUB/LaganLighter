# [LaganLighter:  Structure-Aware High-Performance Graph Algorithms](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter/)

This repository contains the shared-memory CPU-based soure code of the LaganLighter project: https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter .

## How Does It Work?
[LaganLighter source code documentation](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter-Source-Code)

## Requirements
The `libnuma`, `openmp`, and `papi` are required.

## Compiling and Executing Code
 - Set the path to `gcc` compiler folder in Line 1 of the `Makefile`.
 - Please modify Line 6, if the required libraries are not in the path.
 - Run `make alg...` (e.g. `make alg1_sapco_sort`). This builds the executible file and runs it for the test graph. To run it for other graphs, add the path to your graph as the argument to the `.o` executible file (e.g. `obj/alg1_sapco_sort.o path/to/graph`).
 - To disable hyper-threading, please use `no_ht=1` with make.
 - To enable debugging (-g of gcc), use `debug=1`.

## Graph Types
LaganLighter supports  the following graph formats:
 - CSR/CSC graph in text format, for testing, e.g. `data/test_csr.txt`. This format has 4 lines: |V|, |E|, |V| space-separated offsets, and |E| space-separated edges, respectively.  
 - CSR [WebGraph](https://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php) format
 - CSR/CSC binary format
 - CSR/CSC sbin (separated binary) format 

## Bugs & Support
As "we write bugs that in special cases work correctly", we try to evaluate and validate the algorithms and their implementation. If you have received wrong results or you are suspicious about parts of the code, please [contact us](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/DIPSA-QUB/LaganLighter/issues).
