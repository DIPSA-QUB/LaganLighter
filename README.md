# [LaganLighter:  Structure-Aware High-Performance Graph Algorithms](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter/)

This repository contains the soure code of the LaganLighter project: https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter .

## Algorithms in This Repo
 - [SAPCo Sort](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/Sapco-Sort-Optimizing-Degree-Ordering-For-Power-Law-Graphs/): `alg1_sapco_sort` 
 - Other algorithms are going to be added soon. 


## How Does It Work?
[LaganLighter source code documentation](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter-Source-Code-Documentation).

## Requirements
The `libnuma`, `openmp`, and `papi` are required.

## Compiling and Executing Code
 - If you want to use special version of `gcc` compiler please modify Line 1 of the `Makefile`.
 - Please modify Line 6 if the required libraries are not in the path.
 - Run `make alg...` (e.g. `make alg1_sapco_sort`). This builds the executible file and runs it for the test graph. To run it for other graphs, add the path to your graph as the argument.
 - To disable hyper-threading, please use `no_ht=1` with make.
 - To enable debugging (-g of gcc), use `debug=1`.

## Graph Types
We support different types of the graphs:
 - Graphs in txt format, for testing, e.g. `data/test_csr.txt`
 - [WebGraph](https://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php) format
 - Binary format

## Bugs & Support
As "We write bugs that in special cases work correctly", we always try to evaluate and validate the algorithms and implementation. If you have received wrong results or you are suspicious about parts of the code, please [contact us](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/GraphProcessing/LaganLighter) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/DIPSA-QUB/LaganLighter/issues).
