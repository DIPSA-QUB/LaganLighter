#  LaganLighter Docs: PoTra Graph Transposition

PoTra is a structure- and architecture-aware graph transposition algorithm for
graphs with skewed degree distribution.
Its source code is available on [alg6_potra.c](../alg6_potra.c) and [trans.c](../trans.c).
For more details please refer to [PoTra paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06872).
